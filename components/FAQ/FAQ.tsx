          <AccordionTrigger>Is this template free?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Yep 100% free! All you have to do is clone the Github Repo. 
            I might make this is a paid template in the future and grandfather the current uses, 
            but in the meantime you can make an optional donation if you want to support me ðŸ˜Š.

          <AccordionTrigger>Seems like a lot of features for a template</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Agree that this template is pretty stacked with packages and there is a lot going on. 
            However, the goal of this template is to rapidly build SaaS's ontop of it and launch ASAP.
            Therefore package size and optimising performance is secondary to shipping a really great product really fast.
